				The greatest ride of my life was about to come up, a truck with a flatboard at the back with about six or seven boys sprawled out on it, and the drivers two young blond farmers from Minnesota, were picking up every single soul they found on that road -- the most smiling, cheerful couple of handsome bumpking you could ever wish to see, both wearing cotton shirts and overalls, nothing else; both thick-wristed and earnest, with howareyou smiles for anybody and anything that came across their path. I ran up, said is there room?. They said sure, hop on room for everybody
